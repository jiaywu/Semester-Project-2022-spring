The "Clarkes_channel_generation.py" is used to generate Clarke's model channels, and the "channel_instances_N50_fd_length1e4.pt" file is the channels we generated and used in the simulation work.

The cost2100/matlab directory comes from https://github.com/cost2100/cost2100. The "channel_generation.m" file is used to generate our COST 2100 channels for the simulation. The generated channels are stored in "channel_50.mat"

The "Clarkes_multiSNR_test.py" is the file for testing the estimation algorithm with different SNR values in Clarke's channel model.

The "Clarkes_example.py" provides a tracking result example.

The "COST_2100_multiSNR_test.py" is the file for testing the estimation algorithm with different SNR values in the COST 2100 channel model.

The "COST_2100_example.py" provides a tracking result example.
